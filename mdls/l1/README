### DESCRIPTION ###

l1 - this is a single subband similar to 
    l8, but uses the dec_fir and mixer instead of
the CIC filter

### COMPILES ###

l1_ver106 - This version corrects the order of the status bits 
	    in the SSG to coincide with the HPC code.  The order
	    is 3. BLANK 2. SR1 1. SR0 0.CAL

l1_ver107 - Add AND gate at valid signal of 10GBE core to improve arming
        reliability, by making sure no data is being clocked in while
        10 GbE core is resetting

l1_ver108 - Replace mixer block with hardcoded "fast mixer" (no multipliers)
        should improve "image" rejection caused by using quantized digital LO
        with asymetric maximum values (-8/8 to 7/8 for 4 bit quantization
        which was previously used.

l1_ver109 - Add delay to multipliers in round blocks to meet timing

l1_ver110 - Change filter response and use 256 tap instead of 64 tap filters

l1_ver111 - downshift values (retaining precision) before filter to avoid overflow

l1_ver112 - new arm logic. Should keep data from flowing while arm signal
        is high, but didn't notice an extra pos-edge on the arm signal so didn't work

l1_ver113 - fixed previous arm logic; now data does not flow during arming
        and tge core is reset 100 cycles after arm goes low.
        Also swapped Real and Imag outputs of filter to keep band same
        orientation as at the ADC
        Also changed requantization to use bits 48:55 instead of 56:63
