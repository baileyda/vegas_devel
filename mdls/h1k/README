h1k design, previously known as mode 01

h1k_ver106.mdl - making small inconsequential change (increasing depth of stokes snap) 
                 to see if design will meet timing when compiled

h1k_ver105.mdl - Tested good model except for timing error in PFB on pol 0

h1k_ver103.mdl - Fixing the 1/8the band issue. This involves setting latency 
to 1 in the relation block of the mirror_spectrum_init.m script in casper_library

h1k_ver102.mdl - changes the order of the status bits to 3. blank, 2. sr1
1. sr0, 0. cal
