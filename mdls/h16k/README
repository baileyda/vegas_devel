### DESIGNS ###

h16k_ver110 - Fixed bug in SSG block: 4 control bits were being taken from top (MSB) of ssg_ms_sel rather 
              than bottom (LSB) as intended

h16k_ver107 - Fix spec_tick interval to proper 2048 cycles. Built at NRAO

h16k_ver106 - Re-integrated fftwbr_core_ver101, added version control blocks
            - built with ska-sa12a environment at NRAO
            - Has error in spec_tick -> 4096 cycles instead of desired 2048. fixed in ver107

h16k_ver105 - Fixing order of the status bits

h16k_ver104 - This design has been updated with the new FFT core that has
	      the 1/8 band fix (fftbr_core_ver101).

h16k_ver101 - Changed the order of the status bits to coincide with the
	      HPC code.  The ordering is now 3. BLANK 2. SR1 1. SR0 0. CAL

fftwbr_core_ver101 - This fft core has been redrawn with the 1/8 band fix...
		      latency in relational block in the mirror_spectrum 
		      script has been set to 1

### COMPILING ###

h16k_verXXX.mdl uses the "Black Boxing" trick to improve the development efficiency. The technique is described in the Casper Memo No.28(http://casper.berkeley.edu/wiki/images/a/a4/Black_box_memo.pdf).

Since some of the steps (Extract entity, place pcores in the design, etc) have been done already, so to compile h16k_ver100.mdl, there's no need to run through every steps described in the memo.
To compile h16k_verXXX.mdl:
0) Enter the directory vegas_devel/newmdls/h16k
1) Open fftwbr_core_ver101.mdl
2) Double click on the System Generator block, click the "Generate" button. Wait for the generation to complete.
3) Open pfbfirr_core.mdl
4) Double click on the System Generator block, click the "Generate" button. Wait for the generation to complete.
5) Open h16k_ver100.mdl
6) Compile it as with other regular mdl files.
